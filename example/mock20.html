                <h2>Book review: Triumph of the City</h2>
                <p><strong>A</strong> Triumph of the City, by Edward Glaeser, is a thrilling and very readable hymn of praise to an invention so vast and so effective that it is generally taken for granted. More than half the global population already live in urban areas and, every month, five million more flood into the cities of the developed and developing worlds. The crowds and poverty of some of these modern cities may horrify us. They shouldn't, says Glaeser; they are signs of growth, energy and aspiration. Cities are our best and brightest hope.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> This idea has had more than two hundred years of resistance. Not long after the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, the Romantic poets turned away from the smoke and factories of their cities to celebrate the air and light of untouched nature. In 19th-century America, the writer Henry David Thoreau retreated to the wilderness of Walden Pond to live the solitary, simple life, and convinced generations of Americans that cities were bad and nature was good.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> They had, Glaeser admits, a point. The early industrial cities were dirty, since they lacked efficient waste-disposal systems, and disease spread rapidly among the population. But more importantly they were profitable, and there were enormous commercial incentives to make them work, as well as political ones. Their transformation could be achieved at a stroke: in the second half of the 19th century, the French Emperor Napoleon III gave Baron Haussmann unrestricted power to turn the slum-infested city of Paris into one of the wonders and delights of the modern world. Or the transformation could be done by trial and error. Glaeser gives a brilliant account of the stop-start progression of New York to its late 20th-century position as the cultural and economic centre of the world. Either way, Paris, New York and other cities developed because they were truly effective markets of ideas and innovation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> For these and many other reasons, we should not be so upset by the spectacle of urban poverty. The poor flock to cities in the hope of becoming richer (which, by and large, they do). They also reinvigorate the economy of the city. It is folly to drive them away by forcing property prices to soar with unreasonable planning regulations. Instead, cities should build more houses and thereby hold property prices in check.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> It can go wrong, of course. In Glaeser's view, this is primarily because municipal authorities fail to understand the principal virtues of their cities. The heart of Paris, as many Parisians say, is turning into a museum because of the desire to preserve Baron Haussmann's 19th-century boulevards. Glaeser defends their preservation, but argues that in the 1950s the French made a mistake in establishing a huge high-rise commercial development — La Défense — on the outskirts of the city. Far better, he says, to have turned the central area of Montparnasse into a new commercial district. This would have revitalised much of the city centre without destroying its fabric. In India, Mumbai could save itself from ever-more inefficient sprawl over the surrounding area simply by relaxing the rules presently imposed on the height of new constructions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> In America, it is the suburbs that have proved to be the real disaster. Glaeser is repentant on this subject himself. He moved to the suburbs when he had children. His entirely legitimate excuse is that the government made him (and millions like him) do it. By under-taxing petrol and imposing tight planning restrictions on inner cities that drove up the cost of property, it made flight to the suburbs more or less inevitable for the middle classes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>G</strong> This is a disaster because nothing is more inefficient than a suburb. Suburbanites mingle less, and lose the face-to-face contact that makes being an urbanite so much more creative. Moreover, houses are costlier to heat and cool than flats, and suburbanites drive thousands more miles per year than city dwellers. Every aspect of life involves more consumption. This leads to the strongest and newest argument in favour of cities — they are good for the environment. To live in the country or the suburbs is to have a vastly larger carbon footprint than any urbanite.</p>
                
                <p><strong>H</strong> Full of characters and accessible information, this is a tremendous book, not least because, like me, you will find yourself constantly seeking reasons to disagree. Like the poor in the city, this is a sign of success. If you hate the city and get moist-eyed at the thought of the country then, one way or another, Glaeser is the man you will have to take on.</p>

                <h2>How to be Happy</h2>
                <p><em>Some recent developments in the science of happiness</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> A psychiatrist Tony Fernando was walking down the street when he saw a group of young homeless men sitting on the footpath. As Fernando handed out gifts of food, he tried to video the men's reactions in his mind, recording how their gratitude lifted him in return. 'I felt warm, content, meaningful,' he says. Fernando believes the brain can be trained to make us happy and that his 'video method' is one way to achieve this. In fact, a growing body of scientific research internationally is showing how we can learn happiness in the same way we can learn to play the piano. In the soft tissue that forms the brain, there are approximately ten trillion synapses connecting roughly a hundred billion neurons. Active synapses become more sensitive; less active synapses die, but new ones grow quickly. This is relatively new thinking – just 30 years ago, neuroscientists believed that adult brain cells couldn't regenerate. One of the pioneers in this field is University of Wisconsin professor Richard Davidson. He studied Buddhist monks using brain scans in his research facility, and found that those trained in meditation had higher levels of activity in the left prefrontal cortex – the area associated with happiness. Davidson believes that the trained brain is physically different from the untrained one.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> The idea that we can train our brains to find more happiness has been called 'mindfulness' by neuropsychologist Rick Hanson, author of Hardwiring Happiness. It was in college that Hanson, quite unintentionally, first recognised the importance of something that would become his life's work. As an unconfident teenager, he discovered he could turn a small event, 'a young woman smiling at me', into a good feeling he could hold on to. To do this, Hanson employs exactly the same imaginary 'video method' as psychiatrist Tony Fernando. 'The brain takes its shape from what the mind rests upon,' says Hanson. If you keep resting your mind on self-criticism and worries, he argues, your brain will be shaped by that. Hanson explains that resting it on pleasant feelings and the things you have accomplished means that over time your brain will take on a different shape, with strength and optimism hard-wired into it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> In New Zealand, the Mental Health Foundation runs mindfulness programmes in 14 schools. Foundation CEO Judi Clements says, 'It's a valuable approach because children are told to pay attention, but aren't told how to pay attention.' Preliminary results on the outcomes found that children had sustained increases in well-being. The Foundation recognises five pathways to happiness – being active, connecting with others, taking notice, learning and giving. And, says Clements, 'We're detecting a hunger for it from different organisations and professions as well, so the Foundation is soon going to pilot an online "well-being game" in several workplaces.' The project leader is psychologist Carsten Grimm, who is interested in whether some pathways to happiness are more effective than others. In a study, Grimm recorded the activities and corresponding happiness scores of 173 people. What he found was that people who used several pathways to happiness achieved the best results, suggesting it's better to have a balance than concentrate on the single pathway you most identify with.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> However, Associate Professor of Psychological Medicine Nathan Consedine greets our relentless search for the secrets to happiness with a tired sigh. 'The more you chase it, the less you get it,' he says, quoting studies showing those who value contentment and well-being are, in fact, less happy. The big question, he says, is whether there's any benefit in actively seeking happiness. He cites a study, for example, which showed that people who were happier were less inclined to show sympathy. Consedine says that's probably because happy people are strongly motivated to stay happy, but engaging sympathetically with others typically involves engaging with their distress, and that's going to reduce their own happiness. Consedine's not disagreeing with the theory of mindfulness, but believes there's more work to be done.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> Some of that work is being conducted at Auckland University's Centre for Brain Research. Associate Professor Johanna Montgomery has been studying Hanson's theory – that altering our brain activity at a synaptic level affects our behaviour. She accepts that it's a logical explanation based on studies from animals, but we haven't yet got the technology to prove it scientifically in humans. It's true that MRI scans certainly do indicate an increased flow of blood to different areas of the brain which are experiencing positive stimuli. However, she warns that this is a long way from confirming that the brain itself is developing or strengthening.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Nonetheless, Montgomery believes she is making progress. In the laboratory, when scientists want to experiment with synaptic connections, they stimulate the brain with electricity, as this copies the high-frequency firings that happen normally in the brain every second. Using this technique, Montgomery has made a number of findings. For example, the hormones that are released routinely in response to good or bad situations – such as adrenaline – act to regulate the brain, in the same way that weather has a regulating effect on human activity more generally. But scientists understand some of these stimuli better than others. More is known about the impact on brain activity of prolonged periods of fear than the effects of 'happiness' hormones that are released by positive events in life. This is one potentially important area that she hopes to investigate further in future.</p>

                <h2>Yawning</h2>
                <p><em>how and why we yawn still presents problems for researchers in an area which has only recently been opened up to study.</em></p>
                
                <p>When Robert R. Provine began studying yawning in the 1960s, it was difficult for him to convince research students of the merits of 'yawning science'. Although it may appear quirky to some, Provine's decision to study yawning was a logical extension of his research in developmental neuroscience.</p>
                
                <p>The verb to yawn is derived from the Old English ganien or ginian, meaning to gape or open wide. But in addition to gaping jaws, yawning has significant features that are easy to observe and analyse. Provine 'collected' yawns to study by using a variation of the contagion response*. He asked people to "think about yawning" and, once they began to yawn, to depress a button that would record from the start of the yawn to the exhalation at its end.</p>
                
                <p>Provine's early discoveries can be summarized as follows: the yawn is highly stereotyped but not invariant in its duration and form. It is an excellent example of the instinctive fixed-action pattern of classical animal-behaviour study, or ethology. It is not a reflex (short-duration, rapid, proportional response to a simple stimulus), but, once started, a yawn progresses with the inevitability of a sneeze. The standard yawn runs its course over about six seconds on average, but its duration can range from about three seconds to much longer than the average. There are no half-yawns: this is an example of the typical intensity of fixed-action patterns and a reason why you cannot stifle yawns. Just like a cough, yawns can come in bouts with a highly variable inter-yawn interval, which is generally about 68 seconds but rarely more than 70. There is no relation between yawn frequency and duration: producers of short or long yawns do not compensate by yawning more or less often. Furthermore, Provine's hypotheses about the form and function of yawning can be tested by three informative yawn variants which can be used to look at the roles of the nose, the mouth and the jaws.</p>
                
                <h3>i The closed-nose yawn</h3>
                <p>Subjects are asked to pinch their nose closed when they feel themselves start to yawn. Most subjects report being able to perform perfectly normal closed-nose yawns. This indicates that the inhalation at the onset of a yawn, and the exhalation at its end, need not involve the nostrils — the mouth provides a sufficient airway.</p>
                
                <h3>ii The clenched-teeth yawn</h3>
                <p>Subjects are asked to clench their teeth when they feel themselves start to yawn but allow themselves to inhale normally through their open lips and clenched teeth. This variant gives one the sensation of being stuck mid-yawn. This shows that gaping of the jaws is an essential component of the fixed-action pattern of the yawn, and unless it is accomplished, the programme will not run to completion. The yawn is also shown to be more than a deep breath, because, unlike normal breathing, inhalation and exhalation cannot be performed so well through the clenched teeth as through the nose.</p>
                
                <h3>iii The nose yawn</h3>
                <p>This variant tests the adequacy of the nasal airway to sustain a yawn. Unlike normal breathing, which can be performed equally well through mouth or nose, yawning is impossible via nasal inhalation alone. As with the clenched-teeth yawn, the nose yawn provides the unfulfilling sensation of being stuck in mid-yawn. Exhalation, on the other hand, can be accomplished equally well through nose or mouth. Through this methodology Provine demonstrated that inhalation through the oral airway and the gaping of jaws are necessary for normal yawns. The motor programme for yawning will not run to completion without feedback that these parts of the programme have been accomplished.</p>
                
                <p>But yawning is a powerful, generalised movement that involves much more than airway manoeuvres and jaw-gaping. When yawning you also stretch your facial muscles, tilt your head back, narrow or close your eyes, produce tears, salivate, open the Eustachian tubes of your middle ear and perform many other, yet unspecified, cardiovascular and respiratory acts. Perhaps the yawn shares components with other behaviour. For example, is the yawn a kind of 'slow sneeze', or is the sneeze a 'fast yawn'? Both share common respiratory and other features including jaw gaping, eye closing and head tilting.</p>
                
                <p>Yawning and stretching share properties and may be performed together as parts of a global motor complex. Studies by J. I. P. de Vries et al. in the early 1980s, charting movement in the developing foetus using ultrasound, observed a link between yawning and stretching. The most extraordinary demonstration of the yawn-stretch linkage occurs in many people paralysed on one side of their body because of brain damage caused by a stroke: the prominent British neurologist Sir Francis Walshe noted in 1923 that when these people yawn, they are startled and mystified to observe that their otherwise paralysed arm rises and flexes automatically in what neurologists term an 'associated response'. Yawning apparently activates undamaged, unconsciously controlled connections between the brain and the motor system, causing the paralysed limb to move. It is not known whether the associated response is a positive prognosis for recovery, nor whether yawning is therapeutic for prevention of muscular deterioration.</p>
                
                <p>Provine speculated that, in general, yawning may have many functions, and selecting a single function from the available options may be an unrealistic goal. Yawning appears to be associated with a change of behavioural state, switching from one activity to another. Yawning is also a reminder that ancient and unconscious behaviour linking us to the animal world lurks beneath the veneer of culture, rationality and language.</p>

                    <h4>Auckland University's Centre for Brain Research</h4>

                    <p>Through his observations of yawns, Provine was able to confirm that 27 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q27"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> do not exist.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just like a 28 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q28"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div>, yawns cannot be interrupted after they have begun. This is because yawns occur as a 29 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q29"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> rather than a stimulus–response, as was previously thought.</p>
                    
                    <p>In measuring the time taken to yawn, Provine found that a typical yawn lasts about 30 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q30"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div>. He also found that it is common for people to yawn a number of times in quick succession, with the yawns usually being around 31 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q31"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> apart. When studying whether length and rate were connected, Provine concluded that people who yawn less do not necessarily produce 32 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q32"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> to make up for this.</p>
