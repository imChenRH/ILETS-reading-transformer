                <h2>Ambergris</h2>
                <p><em>What is it and where does it come from?</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> In the ancient world, the waxy grey substance we now refer to as ambergris was highly prized for its medicinal properties, and was widely used as a spice, which was believed to be an aphrodisiac when added to food or wine. Ambergris itself is pleasantly aromatic, especially when warmed, and it was also highly valued as a fixing agent in the making of perfume, since it enabled a scent to retain its fragrance for much longer than might otherwise have been possible. Most ambergris was found in the form of lumps floating on the surface of the sea, or washed up on the shores of tropical and temperate oceans. At one time, ambergris was worth its weight in gold, but there was much confusion about its origins.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> Ambergris was known to the Arabs as 'ambar' and was originally called amber in the West in the Middle Ages. This eventually led to further confusion in the popular mind between ambergris and true amber, the mineral known to mineralogists as succinite, which is actually fossilised tree resin, and generally yellow in colour. Both substances were rare and costly, and both were associated with the sea, largely because for Europeans the most common source of amber was the shores of the Baltic. In Chapter 92 of Moby Dick, the American writer Herman Melville pours scorn on those who believed the two substances to be the same: 'Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far-inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odourless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant that it is largely used in perfumery.'</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> Moby Dick was published in 1851, by which time the mystery of the origins of ambergris had been resolved by the scientific community. In 1783, the botanist Joseph Banks, who had accompanied Captain James Cook on his voyages of discovery in the Pacific, presented a paper to the Royal Society of London by the German physician Dr Franz Xavier Schwediawer in which it was conclusively proved that ambergris came from sperm whales. In this, he was confirming an observation made in the 13th century by the great Venetian traveller Marco Polo who, while on the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean, had witnessed a sperm whale vomiting up ambergris. But whereas Marco Polo imagined that the whale had swallowed the lump in the depths of the sea, Schwediawer showed that the origin of the material was inside the whale itself.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> The sperm whale is the largest of the odontocetes, or toothed whales. Males can grow up to 20 metres in length. Melville described the sperm whale as 'the king of whales', and his novel Moby Dick is based on the pursuit of one such creature. Sperm whales are renowned for their ability to dive to great depths, possibly as far as 3 000 metres below the surface, and for remaining underwater for periods of two hours or more in pursuit of their favourite prey, the giant squid.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> It is from the problems the whales have in digesting the beaks of such creatures that ambergris has its origins. The beak is sharp and irritates the whale's lower intestine, which responds by producing a black, foul-smelling liquid. It is not clear to scientists whether this secretion should be considered a normal response by the whale's digestive system or a pathological one, but from time to time large quantities of the liquid are vomited up by the whale. Once outside the whale's body and exposed to air, the substance hardens, acquiring the waxy, greyish and pleasantly aromatic characteristics of ambergris. Often the beaks of squid are still found embedded in lumps of ambergris, some of which can weigh several hundred kilograms. Melville took some delight in contrasting the origins of ambergris with the high value placed upon it by refined society: 'Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale!'</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Sperm whales were ruthlessly pursued by commercial whalers in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1963-64 alone, almost 30 000 individuals were killed, and only the imposition of a ban on the hunting of sperm whales in 1984 saved the species from extinction. Ambergris was by far the most valuable product to be extracted during the processing of the whales' carcasses, and over 90 per cent of the annual worldwide total was acquired in this way, as a by-product of commercial whaling. However, even before the ban on hunting sperm whales was imposed, the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act had prohibited trade in ambergris. Just as petroleum and plastic products were replacing other natural products of whaling, so ambergris was supplanted in the making of perfume by other materials, some natural and some synthetic in origin. Nevertheless, it is possible that, as sperm-whale populations recover to their former numbers in the wild, so the sight of lumps of ambergris washed ashore along the tide-line will once again become a familiar one to beach-combers the world over.</p>

                <h2>The Tasmanian Tiger</h2>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> The Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, was a carnivorous marsupial (a meat-eating mammal which carries its young in a pouch). It was given the name 'tiger' because it had striped fur, and because it was ferocious. Between 24 million and 15 million years ago, many types of thylacine roamed across Australia, their powerful jaws playing a role in maintaining a balance in the ecosystems of their day. Some species were fox-sized, while others were barely the size of kittens.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> But when a period of climate change cooled Australia about 12 million years ago, the numbers of these ancient thylacines began to decline. By about 3 million years ago, only one species was left. About 4,000 years ago, these vanished completely from the Australian mainland, so that Tasmania, a large island to the south of Australia, became the last remaining place where thylacines existed. They ruled the island's animal life unchallenged until Europeans—with sheep, dogs and a great indifference to native flora and fauna—seem to have brought about their extinction. In 1936, the last captive Tasmanian tiger died in Hobart Zoo. Since then, many expeditions have searched for tigers in the Tasmanian bush, but no definitive evidence has been found. Despite this, there are many who keep searching.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> In 1981, Dutch-born zoologist Hans Naarding was in Tasmania conducting a survey of Latham's snipe, a species of endangered bird. One night, he saw an animal in the light from the searchlight mounted on his vehicle. He described it as about the size of a large dog, but with slightly sloping hindquarters and a fairly thick tail continuing straight on from its backbone. He said that it had 12 distinct stripes on its back, running down to the point where the tail began. He reported the sighting to the Director of Tasmania's National Parks. "When the news broke," said Naarding, "I was besieged by television crews, including four or five from Japan, and others from the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand and South America."</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> Government and private search parties combed the region, but no further sightings were made. The tiger, as always, had escaped to its lair—a place that many insist exists only in the imagination. Others disagree: there have been more than 4,000 claimed sightings of the animal since it supposedly died out, and the average number of claims reported to the authorities each year is now 150. So is it out there? Even experts differ in opinion.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> Randolph Rose, Associate Professor of Zoology at the University of Tasmania, says that he once dreamed of seeing a thylacine, but is now convinced that his dream will go unfulfilled. The consensus among conservationists is that any animal with a population base of less than 1,000 is headed for extinction within 60 years. "Sixty years ago," he says, "there was only one thylacine that we know of, and that was in Hobart Zoo. Take it from me, the tiger is gone." But Dr David Pemberton, curator of zoology at the Tasmanian Museum, states that, despite scientific thinking that a relatively large population is required to sustain a species, "the Florida panther is down to a dozen or so animals, and, while it does have some inbreeding problems, it's still ticking along! After all, animals can be notoriously elusive. The strange fish known as the coelacanth, with its 'proto legs,' was thought to have died out with the dinosaurs 700 million years ago, until a specimen was dragged to the surface in a shark net off the coast of South Africa in 1938."</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Wildlife biologist Nick Mooney has the unenviable task of investigating all so-called sightings of the tiger. It was Mooney who was first consulted in late February 2005 about the authenticity of new digital photographic images of a thylacine allegedly taken by a tourist. "On face value," Mooney says, "this particular account of a sighting and the photographs submitted as proof amount to one of the most convincing cases for the species' survival that I have seen." Many other 'sightings' have been hoaxes, and many sincere seekers are victims of obsession. "It is a blind optimism that something is, rather than cynicism that something isn't," Mooney says. "If something crosses the road, it's not a case of 'I wonder what that was?' Rather, it is a case of 'That's a thylacine!'"</p>
                
                <p><strong>G</strong> However, Mooney treats all sightings at face value. "I never try to embarrass people," he says, "but the fact that I don't pack the car immediately after they telephone can often be taken as ridicule. Obsessive characters get angry that someone in my position is not out there when they think the thylacine is there."</p>
                
                <p><strong>H</strong> Hans Naarding, whose sighting of a striped animal two decades ago was the highlight of a lifetime of animal spotting, remains puzzled by the time and money people waste on tiger searches. He says resources would be better applied to saving another endangered animal, the Tasmanian devil, and helping declining migratory bird populations. Could the thylacine still be out there? "Sure," Naarding says. "I know the vast south-west wilderness of Tasmania well. They could survive ... [But] if this is the case, it will not be long before they do disappear completely." Naarding believes that any discovery of surviving thylacines would be "rather pointless." "How do you bring a species back from extinction?" he asks. "What could you do with it? If there are thylacines out there, they are better off right where they are."</p>

                <h2>The Pirahã people of Brazil</h2>
                <p><em>The Pirahã language has stirred up debate among experts</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> The Pirahā tribe live deep in Brazil's Amazon forest, and their language is hotly debated by linguists. Since 1977, the ethnologist Daniel Everett has spent a total of seven years living with the Pirahā and has committed his career to studying their puzzling speech. Indeed, he was uncertain for so long about what he was actually hearing while living among the Pirahā that he waited nearly three decades before publishing his findings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> The debate over the Pirahā language goes right to the core of the riddle regarding how Homo sapiens managed to develop vocal communication. Although bees dance, birds sing and whales even sing with syntax, human language is unique, if only for the reason that it enables humans to piece together never-before-constructed thoughts, and be infinitely imaginative - think of Shakespeare's plays or Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> Linguistics generally focuses on what features all human languages have in common, but the Pirahā language departs from what some academics have long maintained are essential and inalienable features of all human languages. Most of all, it may be unique for not employing subordinate clauses. Instead of saying, 'When I have finished eating, I will speak to you,' the Pirahā say, 'I finish eating, I speak with you.' Equally perplexing, the Pirahā appear not to use numbers. During the time he spent with them, Everett never heard words like 'all', 'every' and 'more'. There is one word, 'hoi', that comes close to the numeral 1, but it can also mean 'small'. And they were never observed to count without language, on their fingers for example, in order to determine important tasks in village life like how many pieces of meat to grill.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> Everett's findings among the Pirahā have brought new life to a controversial theory by the linguist Benjamin Whorf, who suggested that people are only capable of constructing thoughts for which they possess actual words. Or to put it another way, because they have no words for numbers, they cannot even begin to understand the concept of numbers or arithmetic.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> The Warlpiri language - spoken by a group of Australian Aborigines - like that of the Pirahā, features only the most rudimentary system of counting. However, the Warlpiri people had no difficulty counting farther than three in a foreign language, in this case English, but when Everett attempted to teach the Pirahā how to count in Portuguese, like other Brazilians, not a single person could count to 10.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Everett is at pains to point out that the Pirahā are not unintelligent, for their thinking is not any slower than that of the average university student. And although they reside in a remote part of the forest, they do not live in complete genetic isolation, but mix with people from the surrounding populations and share similar intellectual capacities with their neighbours whose languages do contain numbers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>G</strong> Eventually, after some 30 years of research, Everett has come up with a surprising explanation for the peculiarities of the Pirahā language. Language, he believes, is created by a people's way of life, their belief system and values. In this way, variety in human language is almost limitless, a function of the human capacity to live in different ways, such as in the forest. What Everett's research has revealed is that the central tenet of the Pirahā culture is to live in the here and now. The only thing of importance that is worth communicating to others is what is being experienced at that very moment, though this can often be described with great care and detail. In consequence, the language has no means to conjugate verbs in order to describe 'yesterday' or 'last week' or 'when I was a child'. Their very literal view of the world curtails abstract thought, and many features taken for granted among other peoples are absent among the Pirahā, such as a creation myth, storytelling and painting. One manifestation of their beliefs is that by tradition the names they give their children are not particularly imaginative. Often they are named after other members of the tribe with whom they share similar character traits. Standing out or being different is not encouraged by the Pirahā, and this is reflected in their perhaps colourless choice of names.</p>
                
                <p><strong>H</strong> Everett anticipated that these findings would be controversial and the reaction came as expected. Until this point, many linguists had defended the theories of Noam Chomsky, according to which all human languages have a universal grammar. What exactly makes up this universal grammar is the subject of debate, but at its heart is the concept of 'recursion', which is defined as replication of a structure within its single parts. Without it, humans would not be able to view separate thoughts as subordinate parts of a complex whole. And, most pertinent to Everett's work, there would not be subordinate clauses, which are responsible for translating the concept of recursion into grammar. But if the Pirahā do not form subordinate clauses, then recursion cannot explain the uniqueness of human language, and this would negate Chomsky's theories.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I</strong> The logical way forward now would be to try to prove that the Pirahā can think in a recursive fashion. The only problem is, nobody can confirm or deny Everett's observations since no other researcher can speak Pirahā as well as he does. Despite this, several researchers - including two of Chomsky's colleagues - will soon travel to Brazil to check his claims. My concern is that soon the Pirahā will simply become one more scientific oddity with every aspect of their lives being exploited and analysed.</p>
