                <h2>Thomas Young: The last man who knew everything</h2>
                <p><strong>A</strong> Thomas Young (1773–1829) contributed 63 articles to the great British encyclopaedia, Encyclopaedia Britannica, including 46 biographical entries (mostly on scientists and classical scholars) and substantial essays on ‘Bridge’ (a card game), ‘Egypt’, ‘Languages’ and ‘Tides’. Was someone who could write authoritatively about so many subjects a genius, or a dilettante? In an ambitious biography, Andrew Robinson argues that Young is a good contender to be described as “the last man who knew everything”. Young has competition, however: the phrase, which Robinson uses as the title of his biography of Young, also serves as the subtitle of two other recent biographies – Leonard Warren’s 1998 life of palaeontologist Joseph Leidy (1823–1891) and Paula Findlen’s 2004 book on Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680).</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> Young, of course, did more than write encyclopaedia entries. He presented his first paper, on the human eye, to the prestigious academic institution, the Royal Society of London, at the age of 20 and was elected a Fellow of the Society shortly afterwards. In the paper, which sought to explain how the eye focuses on objects at varying distances, Young hypothesised that this was achieved by changes in the shape of the lens. He also theorised that light travels in waves and believed that, to be able to see in colour, there must be three receptors in the eye corresponding to the three principal colours (red, green and violet) to which the retina could respond. All these hypotheses were subsequently proved correct.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> Later in his life, when he was in his forties, Young was instrumental in cracking the code that unlocked the unknown script on the Rosetta Stone, a tablet found in Egypt by the Napoleonic army in 1799. The stone has text in three alphabets: Greek, Egyptian hieroglyphs and another script that was originally unrecognisable. The unrecognisable script is now known as demotic and, as Young deduced, is directly related to Egyptian hieroglyphs. His initial work on this appeared in the Britannica entry ‘Egypt’. In another entry, Young coined the term ‘Indo-European’ to describe the family of languages spoken throughout most of Europe and northern India. These works are landmark achievements for a man who was a child prodigy but who, unlike many remarkable children, did not fade into obscurity as an adult.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> Born in 1773 in Somerset, England, Young lived with his maternal grandfather from an early age. He devoured books from the age of two and excelled at Latin, Greek, mathematics and natural philosophy (the 18th-century term for science). After leaving school, he was greatly encouraged by Richard Brocklesby, a physician and Fellow of the Royal Society. Following Brocklesby’s lead, Young decided to pursue a career in medicine. He studied in London and then moved on to more formal education in Edinburgh, Göttingen and Cambridge. After completing his medical training at the University of Cambridge in 1808, Young set up practice as a physician in London and, a few years later, was appointed physician at St George’s Hospital.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> Young’s skill as a physician, however, did not equal his talent as a scholar of natural philosophy or linguistics. In 1801, he had been appointed to a professorship of natural philosophy at the Royal Institution, where he delivered as many as 60 lectures a year. His opinions were sought by civic and national authorities on matters such as the introduction of gas lighting to London streets and methods of ship construction. From 1819, he was Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac and Secretary to the Board of Longitude. Between 1816 and 1825, he contributed many entries to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and throughout his career he authored numerous other essays, papers and books.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Young is a perfect subject for a biography – perfect, but daunting. Few men contributed so much to so many technical fields. Robinson’s aim is to introduce non-scientists to Young’s work and life. He succeeds, providing clear expositions of the technical material (especially that on optics and Egyptian hieroglyphs). Some readers of this book will, like Robinson, find Young’s accomplishments impressive; others will see him, as some historians have, as a dilettante. Yet despite the rich material presented in this book, readers will not end up knowing Young personally. We catch glimpses of a playful Young, doodling Greek and Latin phrases in his notes on medical lectures and translating the verses that a young lady had written on the walls of a summerhouse into Greek elegiacs. Young was introduced into elite society, attended the theatre and learned to dance and play the flute. In addition, he was an accomplished horseman. However, his personal life looks pale next to his vibrant career and studies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>G</strong> Young married Eliza Maxwell in 1804, and according to Robinson, "their marriage was happy and she appreciated his work". Almost all we know about her is that she sustained her husband through some acrimonious disputes about optics and that she worried about money when his medical career was slow to take off. Little evidence survives concerning the complexities of Young’s relationships with his mother and father, and Robinson does not credit them with shaping Young’s extraordinary mind. Despite the lack of personal detail, anyone interested in what it means to be a genius should read this book.</p>

                <h2>Keeping the water away</h2>
                <p><em>New approaches to flood control</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> Recently, winter floods on the rivers of central Europe have been among the worst for 600 to 700 years, and dams and dykes (protective sea walls) have failed to solve the problem. Traditionally, river engineers have tried to get rid of the water quickly, draining it off the land and down to the sea in rivers reengineered as high-performance drains. But however high they build the artificial riverbanks, the floods keep coming back. And when they come, they seem to be worse than ever.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> Engineers are now turning to a different plan: to sap the water's destructive strength by dispersing it into fields, forgotten lakes and flood plains. They are reviving river bends and marshes to curb the flow, and even plugging city drains to encourage floodwater to use other means to go underground. Back in the days when rivers took a winding path to the sea, floodwaters lost force and volume while meandering across flood plains and inland deltas, but today the water tends to have a direct passage to the sea. This means that, when it rains in the uplands, the water comes down all at once.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> Worse, when the flood plains are closed off, the river's flow downstream becomes more violent and uncontrollable; by turning complex river systems into the simple mechanics of a water pipe, engineers have often created danger where they promised safety. The Rhine, Europe's most engineered river, is a good example. For a long time engineers have erased its backwaters and cut it off from its plain. The aim was partly to improve navigation, and partly to speed floodwaters out of the Alps and down to the North Sea. Now, when it rains in the Alps, the peak flows from several branches of the Rhine coincide where once they arrived separately, and with four-fifths of the Lower Rhine's flood plain barricaded off, the waters rise. The result is more frequent flooding and greater damage. The same thing has happened in the US on the Mississippi River, which drains the world's second-largest river catchment into the Gulf of Mexico. Despite some $7 billion spent over the last century on levees (embankments), the situation is growing worse.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> Specialists in water control now say that a new approach is needed — one which takes the whole landscape into consideration. To help keep London's feet dry, the UK Environment Agency is reflooding 10 square kilometres of the ancient flood plain of the River Thames outside Oxford. Nearer to London, it has spent £100 million creating new wetlands and a relief channel across 16 kilometres of flood plain. Similar ideas are being tested in Austria, in one of Europe's largest river restorations to date. The engineers calculate that the restored flood plain of the Drava River can now store up to 10 million cubic metres of floodwater, and slow down storm surges coming out of the Alps by more than an hour, protecting towns not only in Austria, but as far downstream as Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> The Dutch, for whom preventing floods is a matter of survival, have gone furthest. This nation, built largely on drained marshes and seabed, has had several severe shocks in the last two decades, when very large numbers of people have had to be evacuated. Since that time, the Dutch have broken one of their most enduring national stereotypes by allowing engineers to punch holes in dykes. They plan to return up to a sixth of the country to its former waterlogged state in order to better protect the rest.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Water use in cities also needs to change. At the moment, cities seem to create floods; they are concreted and paved so that rains flow quickly into rivers. A new breed of 'soft engineers' wants cities to be porous; Berlin is one place where this is being done. Tough new rules for new developments mean that drains will be prevented from becoming overloaded after heavy rains. Architects of new urban buildings are diverting rainwater from the roofs for use in toilets and the irrigation of roof gardens, while water falling onto the ground is collected in ponds, or passes underground through porous paving. One high-tech urban development can store a sixth of its annual rainfall, and reuse most of the rest.</p>
                
                <p><strong>G</strong> Could this be expanded to protect a whole city? The test case could be Los Angeles. With non-porous surfaces covering 70% of the city, drainage is a huge challenge. Billions of dollars have been spent digging huge drains and concreting riverbeds, but many communities still flood regularly. Meanwhile, this desert city ships water from hundreds of kilometres away to fill its taps and swimming pool. Los Angeles has recently launched a new scheme to utilise floodwater in the Sun Valley section of the city. The plan is to catch the rain that falls on thousands of driveways, parking lots and rooftops in the valley. Trees will soak up water from parking lots; houses and public buildings will capture roof water to irrigate gardens and parks, and road drains will empty into old gravel pits to recharge the city's underground water reserves. Result: less flooding and more water for the city. It may sound expensive, until we realise how much is spent trying to drain cities and protect areas from flooding, and how little this method achieves.</p>

                <h2>What makes a musical expert?</h2>
                <p><em>How does someone become expert in music? And is it really possible to have a talent for music?</em></p>
                
                <p>Does that class of people acknowledged to be musical experts just have more of the same basic skills we are all endowed with, or do they have a set of abilities — or neural structures — that are totally different from those of the rest of us? Are high levels of musical achievement simply the result of training and practice, or are they based on innate brain structure — what we refer to as talent? Talent can be defined as something that originates in genetic structures and that is identifiable by trained people who can recognize its existence before a person has achieved exceptional levels of performance. The emphasis on early identification means that to investigate it, we study the development of skills in children.</p>
                
                <p>It is evident that some children acquire skills more rapidly than others: the age of onset for walking and talking varies widely, even between children in the same household. There may be genetic factors at work, but these are closely linked with other factors — with a presumably environmental component — such as motivation and family dynamics. Similar factors can influence musical development and can mask the contribution of genetics to musical ability.</p>
                
                <p>Brain studies, so far, haven't been of much use in sorting out the issues. Gottfried Schlaug at Harvard collected brain scans of individuals with absolute pitch* (AP) and showed that a region in the brain called the planum temporale is larger in these people than in others. This suggests that the planum is involved in AP, but it's not clear if it starts out larger in people who eventually acquire AP, or if the acquisition of AP makes the planum increase in size.</p>
                
                <p>Results of research into the areas of the brain involved in skilled motor movement are more conclusive. Studies of violin players have shown that the region of the brain responsible for controlling the movement of the left hand (the hand that requires greater precision in violin playing) increases in size as a result of practice. We do not know yet if the propensity for increase pre-exists in some people and not others.</p>
                
                <p><em>*individuals with absolute pitch: people who can identify or sing any musical note correctly without help</em></p>
                
                <p>The evidence against talent comes from research on how much training the experts do. Like experts in mathematics, chess, or sports, experts in music require lengthy periods of instruction and practice. In several studies, the very best music students were found to have practised more than twice as much as the others. In another study, students were secretly divided into two groups based on teachers' perceptions of their talent. Several years later, it was found that the students who achieved the highest performance ratings had practised the most, irrespective of which talent group they had been assigned to, suggesting that practice does not merely correlate with achievement, but causes it.</p>
                
                <p>Anders Ericsson, at Florida State University, approaches the topic of musical expertise as a general problem in cognitive psychology. He takes as a starting point the assumption that there are certain issues involved in becoming an expert at anything; that we can learn about musical expertise by studying expert chess players, athletes, artists, mathematicians, as well as the musicians themselves. The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert — in anything. In study after study, of composers, ice-skaters, concert pianists, chess players and master criminals, this number comes up again and again. Someone would do this amount of practice if they practised, for example, roughly 20 hours a week for ten years. Of course, this does not address why some people do not seem to get anywhere when they practise, and why some people get more out of their practice sessions than others. But no-one has yet found a case in which true world-class expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.</p>
                
                <p>The ten-thousand-hour theory is consistent with what we know about how the brain learns. Learning requires the assimilation and consolidation of information in neural tissue. The more experiences we have with something, the stronger the memory/learning trace for that experience becomes. Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which create stronger memory representation.</p>
                
                <p>The classic rebuttal to this theory goes something like this: What about Mozart? I hear that he composed his first symphony at the age of four! First, there is a factual error here: Mozart did not write it until he was eight. Still, this is unusual, to say the least. However, this early work received little acclaim and was not performed very often. In fact, the only reason we know about it is because the child who wrote it grew up to become Mozart. And Mozart had an expert teacher in his father, who was renowned as a teacher of musicians all over Europe. We do not know how much Mozart practised, but if he started at age two and worked thirty-two hours a week (quite possible, given that his father was a stern taskmaster) he would have made his ten thousand hours by the time he composed his first symphony. This does not mean that there are no genetic factors involved in Mozart's greatness, but that inborn traits may not be the only cause.</p>

                    <p>The case of Mozart could be quoted as evidence against the 10,000-hour practice theory. However, the writer points out that the young Mozart received a lot of <div class="dropzone" data-target="q37"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> from his father, and that the symphony he wrote at the age of <div class="dropzone" data-target="q38"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> was not <div class="dropzone" data-target="q39"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> and may be of only academic interest.
