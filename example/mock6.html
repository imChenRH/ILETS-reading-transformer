                <h2>The Blockbuster Phenomenon: A New Museum Trend</h2>
                <p>Museums in Australia, like other pleasure-giving public organizations, are adapting their activities so that they more closely reflect the marketplace.</p>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> Since the 1980s, the term 'blockbuster' has become the fashionable word for spectacular, high-profile museum exhibitions that have the ability to attract large crowds. A blockbuster is a 'large-scale loan exhibition that people who normally don't go to museums will stand in line for hours to see' (Eisen 1984). Once the museum that created the exhibition has shown it to its local market, it can be offered to other organizations for a fee. This means that you can boost your own door takings and make money from boosting someone else's door takings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> While partaking of the excitement of the blockbuster, visitors thus lured are likely to stay longer at the museum. Betty Churcher, when Director of the Australian National Gallery, summed up the new blockbuster creed as follows: 'The bonus of the blockbuster exhibitions is that people come to see the blockbuster and they stay to look at the permanent collection, so you are getting broader exposure for your collection.'</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> Museums across the UK, USA, Canada and Australia currently operate under a system of plural funding: revenue raised through contributions by federal, state and/or local governments, combined with revenue raised through admission charges and other activities. Maintaining and increasing visitor levels is thus paramount and involves not only creating or hiring blockbuster exhibitions, but providing regular exhibition changes and innovations. In addition, the visiting public have become known as customers rather than visitors, and the skills that are valued in museums to keep the new customers coming through the door have changed. Curators are now administrators, and being a museum director no longer requires an Arts degree—but public relations skills are essential if the museum is going to compete with other museums to stage travelling exhibitions which draw huge crowds.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> The convergence of museums, the heritage industry, tourism, profit-making and pleasure-giving has resulted in the new 'museology'. This has given rise to much debate about whether it is appropriate to see museums primarily as tourist attractions. In literature from both the UK and USA, the words that are starting to appear in some descriptions of blockbusters are 'less scholarly', 'non-elitist' and 'popularist', while others extol the virtues of encouraging scholars to co-operate on projects, and to provide exhibitions that cater for a broad selection of the community rather than an elite sector. Whatever commentators may think, managers of museums worldwide are looking for artful ways to blend culture and commerce, and blockbuster exhibitions are at the top of the list.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> But do blockbusters held in public institutions really create a surplus to fund other activities? If the bottom line is profit, then according to the records of many major museums blockbusters do make money. For museums in some countries, it may be the money that they require to replace parts of their collections or to fix buildings that are in need of attention. For some museums in Australia, it may be the opportunity to illustrate that they are attempting to pay their way by recovering part of their operating costs. Also, creating or hiring a blockbuster has many positive spin-offs: blockbusters mean crowds, and crowds are good for the local economy, providing increased trade for shops, hotels, restaurants, the transport industry and retailers. The argument that the arts provide sustained economic benefits has been well illustrated in impact studies in the USA and UK.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> However, blockbusters require large capital expenditure and draw on resources across all branches of an organization, and the costs don't end there. There is a Human Resource Management cost in addition to a measurable 'real' dollar cost. Receiving a touring exhibition draws resources from across functional management structures in a project-management style. Everyone—from general labourers to building services, front-of-house, technical, promotional, educational and administrative staff—is required to perform additional tasks. Furthermore, as an increasing number of institutions try their hand at increasing visitor numbers and memberships (and therefore revenue) by staging blockbuster exhibitions, it may be less likely that blockbusters will continue to provide a surplus to subsidize other activities due to the competitive nature of the market.</p>
                
                <p><strong>G</strong> It has been illustrated in both the UK and USA that the blockbuster ideology has resulted in the false expectation that the momentum required to stage blockbusters can be maintained continually. Creating, mounting or hiring blockbusters is exhausting, with the real costs throughout an institution difficult to calculate. Secondly, as some analysts have argued, the 'shopkeeping' mentality and cost-benefit analysis, and a pure concentration on the bottom line, can squeeze substance out of an exhibition. Taking out substance can be a recipe for blockbuster failure and therefore financial failure.</p>
                
                <p><strong>H</strong> Perhaps the best pathway to take is one that balances both blockbusters and regular exhibitions. However, this easy middle ground may only work if you have enough space, and have alternative sources of funding to continue to support the regular, less exciting fare. Perhaps the advice should be to make sure that you find out what your local community wants from you and make sure that your regular activities and exhibitions are more enduring.</p>

                <h2>How Well Do We Concentrate?</h2>
                
                <p><strong>A</strong> Do you read while listening to music? Do you like to watch TV while finishing your homework? People who have these kinds of habits are called multitaskers. Multitaskers are able to complete two tasks at the same time by dividing their focus. However, Thomas Lehman, a researcher in psychology, believes people never really do multiple things simultaneously. Maybe a person is reading while listening to music, but in reality the brain can only focus on one task. Reading the words in a book will cause you to ignore some of the words of the music. When people think they are accomplishing two different tasks efficiently, what they are really doing is dividing their focus. While listening to music, people become less able to focus on their surroundings. For example, we all have experienced times when we talk with friends and they are not responding properly. Maybe they are listening to someone else talk, or maybe they are reading a text on their smartphone and don't hear what you are saying. Lehman called this phenomenon "email voice."</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> The world has been changed by computers and their spin-offs such as smartphones or cellphones. Now that most individuals have a personal device, like a smartphone or a laptop, they are frequently reading, watching or listening to virtual information. This increases the occurrence of multitasking in our day-to-day life. Nowadays, when you work, you may use your typewriter, your cellphone, and speak with colleagues who may drop by at any time. In professional meetings, when one would normally focus on and listen to one another, people are more likely to have a cellphone in their lap, reading or communicating silently with more people than ever. Even inventions such as the cordless phone have increased multitasking. In the old days, a traditional wall phone would ring, and the housewife would have to stop her activities to answer it. When it rang, the housewife would sit down with her legs up and chat, with no laundry, sweeping or answering the door. In the modern era, our technology is convenient enough not to interrupt our daily tasks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> Earl Miller, an expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studied the prefrontal cortex, which guides the brain while a person is multitasking. According to his studies, the size of this cortex varies between species. He found that for humans, it constitutes one-third of the brain, whereas it is only 4 – 5 percent in dogs and about 15 percent in monkeys. Because this cortex is larger in humans, it allows a person to be more flexible and accurate in multitasking. However, Miller wanted to know whether the cortex was truly processing information about two different tasks simultaneously. He designed an experiment in which he presented visual stimuli to his subjects in a way that mimicked multitasking. Miller then attached sensors to the patients' heads to pick up the electrical patterns of the brain. These sensors would show whether the neurons were truly processing two different tasks. What he found was that the brain neurons lit up in singular areas one at a time—never simultaneously.</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> David Meyer, a professor at the University of Michigan, studied young adults in a similar experiment. He instructed them to solve math problems while simultaneously classifying simple words into different categories. Meyer found that when you think you are doing several jobs at the same time, you are actually switching between jobs. Even though the participants tried to do the tasks at the same time and both tasks were eventually accomplished, overall the task took more time than if the person had focused on a single task.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> People sacrifice efficiency when multitasking. Gloria Mark used office workers as her subjects. She found that they were constantly multitasking. She observed that nearly every 11 minutes people at work were disrupted. She found that doing different jobs at the same time may actually save time. However, despite the fact that they are faster, it does not mean they are more efficient. We are equally likely to self-interrupt as to be interrupted by outside sources. She found that in the office nearly every 12 minutes an employee would stop and, with no reason at all, check a website on their computer, call someone or write an email. If they concentrated for more than 20 minutes, they would feel distressed. She suggested that the average person may suffer from a short concentration span. This short attention span might be natural, but others suggest that new technology may be the problem. With cellphones and computers at our sides at all times, people will never run out of distractions. The format of media—such as advertisements, music, news articles and TV shows—is also shortening, so people are used to paying attention to information for a very short time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>F</strong> Even though focusing on a single task is the most efficient way for our brains to work, it is not always practical in real life. According to human nature, people feel more comfortable and efficient in environments with a variety of tasks. Edward Hallowell said that people are losing a lot of efficiency in the workplace due to multitasking, outside distractions and self-distractions. In fact, the changes made to the workplace do not have to be dramatic. No one is suggesting we ban e-mail or make employees focus on only one task. However, certain common workplace situations—such as group meetings—would be more efficient if we banned cellphones, a common distraction. A person can also apply these tips to prevent self-distraction. Instead of arriving at the office and checking all of your e-mails for new tasks—a common ritual—you could dedicate an hour to a single task first thing in the morning. Self-timing is a great way to reduce distraction and finish tasks one by one, instead of slowing ourselves down with multitasking.</p>

                <p><strong>A</strong> Music is one of the human species' relatively few universal abilities. Without formal training, any individual, from Stone Age tribesman to suburban teenager, has the ability to recognise music and, in some fashion, to make it. Why this should be so is a mystery. After all, music isn't necessary for getting through the day, and if it aids in reproduction, it does so only in highly indirect ways. Language, by contrast, is also everywhere — but for reasons that are more obvious. With language, you and the members of your tribe can organise a migration across Africa, build reed boats and cross the seas, and communicate at night even when you can't see each other. Modern culture, in all its technological extravagance, springs directly from the human talent for manipulating symbols and syntax.</p>
                
                <p>Scientists have always been intrigued by the connection between music and language. Yet over the years, words and melody have acquired a vastly different status in the lab and the seminar room. While language has long been considered essential to unlocking the mechanisms of human intelligence, music is generally treated as an evolutionary frippery — mere "auditory cheesecake", as the Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker puts it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>B</strong> But thanks to a decade-long wave of neuroscience research, that tune is changing. A flurry of recent publications suggests that language and music may equally be able to tell us who we are and where we're from — not just emotionally, but biologically. In July, the journal Nature Neuroscience devoted a special issue to the topic. And in an article in the 6 August issue of the Journal of Neuroscience, David Schwartz, Catherine Howe and Dale Purves of Duke University argued that the sounds of music and the sounds of language are intricately connected.</p>
                
                <p>To grasp the originality of this idea, it's necessary to realise two things about how music has traditionally been understood. First, musicologists have long emphasised that while each culture stamps a special identity onto its music, music itself has some universal qualities. For example, in virtually all cultures, sound is divided into some or all of the 12 intervals that make up the chromatic scale — that is, the scale represented by the keys on a piano. For centuries, observers have attributed this preference for certain combinations of tones to the mathematical properties of sound itself.</p>
                
                <p>Some 2,500 years ago, Pythagoras was the first to note a direct relationship between the harmoniousness of a tone combination and the physical dimensions of the object that produced it. For example, a plucked string will always play an octave lower than a similar string half its size, and a fifth lower than a similar string two-thirds its length. This link between simple ratios and harmony has influenced music theory ever since.</p>
                
                <p><strong>C</strong> This music-is-math idea is often accompanied by the notion that music, formally speaking at least, exists apart from the world in which it was created. Writing recently in The New York Review of Books, pianist and critic Charles Rosen discussed the long-standing notion that while painting and sculpture reproduce at least some aspects of the natural world, and writing describes thoughts and feelings we are all familiar with, music is entirely abstracted from the world in which we live. Neither idea is right, according to David Schwartz and his colleagues. Human musical preferences are fundamentally shaped not by elegant algorithms or ratios but by the messy sounds of real life, and of speech in particular – which in turn is shaped by our evolutionary heritage. "The explanation of music, like the explanation of any product of the mind, must be rooted in biology, not in numbers per se," says Schwartz.</p>
                
                <p>Schwartz, Howe and Purves analysed a vast selection of speech sounds from a variety of languages to reveal the underlying patterns common to all utterances. In order to focus only on the raw sounds, they discarded all theories about speech and meaning, and sliced sentences into random bites. Using a database of over 100,000 brief segments of speech, they noted which frequency had the greatest emphasis in each sound. The resulting set of frequencies, they discovered, corresponded closely to the chromatic scale. In short, the building blocks of music are to be found in speech.</p>
                
                <p>Far from being abstract, music presents a strange analogue to the patterns created by the sounds of speech. "Music, like visual arts, is rooted in our experience of the natural world," says Schwartz. "It emulates our sound environment in the way that visual arts emulate the visual environment." In music we hear the echo of our basic sound-making instrument — the vocal tract. The explanation for human music is simpler still than Pythagoras's mathematical equations: we like the sounds that are familiar to us — specifically, we like the sounds that remind us of us.</p>
                
                <p>This brings up some chicken-or-egg evolutionary questions. It may be that music imitates speech directly, the researchers say, in which case it would seem that language evolved first. It's also conceivable that music came first and language is in effect an imitation of song — that in everyday speech we hit the musical notes we especially like. Alternatively, it may be that music imitates the general products of the human sound-making system, which just happens to be mostly speech. "We can't know this," says Schwartz. "What we do know is that they both come from the same system, and it is this that shapes our preferences."</p>
                
                <p><strong>D</strong> Schwartz's study also casts light on the long-running question of whether animals understand or appreciate music. Despite the apparent abundance of "music" in the natural world — birdsong, whale song, wolf howls, synchronised chimpanzee hooting — previous studies have found that many laboratory animals don't show a great affinity for the human variety of music making.</p>
                
                <p>Marc Hauser and Josh McDermott of Harvard argued in the July issue of Nature Neuroscience that animals don't create or perceive music the way we do. The fact that laboratory monkeys can show recognition of human tunes is evidence, they say, of shared general features of the auditory system, not any specific chimpanzee musical ability. As for birds, those most musical beasts, they generally recognise their own tunes — a narrow repertoire — but don't generate novel melodies like we do. There are no avian Mozarts.</p>
                
                <p>But what's been played to animals, Schwartz notes, is human music. If animals evolve preferences for sound as we do — based upon the soundscape in which they live — then their "music" would be fundamentally different from ours. In the same way our scales derive from human utterances, a cat's idea of a good tune would derive from yowls and meows. To demonstrate that animals don't appreciate sound the way we do, we'd need evidence that they don't respond to "music" constructed from their own sound environment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>E</strong> No matter how the connection between language and music is parsed, what is apparent is that our sense of music, even our love for it, is as deeply rooted in our biology and in our brains as language is. This is most obvious with babies, says Sandra Trehub at the University of Toronto, who also published a paper in the Nature Neuroscience special issue.</p>
                
                <p>For babies, music and speech are on a continuum. Mothers use musical speech to "regulate infants' emotional states", Trehub says. Regardless of what language they speak, the voice all mothers use with babies is the same: "something between speech and song". This kind of communication "puts the baby in a trance-like state, which may proceed to sleep or extended periods of rapture". So if the babies of the world could understand the latest research on language and music, they probably wouldn't be very surprised. The upshot, says Trehub, is that music may be even more of a necessity than we realise.</p>

                    <p>Scientists have long been interested in the connection between music and language. For years, language was considered essential to understanding human intelligence, while music was often dismissed as evolutionary 27 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q27"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div>. However, recent neuroscience research suggests that both music and language can tell us about our 28 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q28"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> origins.</p>
                    
                    <p>Traditional music theory emphasized the 29 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q29"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> basis of music, with Pythagoras noting the relationship between harmony and physical dimensions. In contrast, Schwartz and his colleagues argue that musical preferences are shaped by the sounds of real life, especially 30 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q30"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div>, and are rooted in 31 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q31"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> rather than mathematics.</p>
                    
                    <p>When it comes to animals' appreciation of music, Schwartz notes that previous studies may be flawed because they used 32 <div class="dropzone" data-target="q32"><span class="droplabel">Drag answer here</span></div> rather than music based on animals' own sound environments.</p>
